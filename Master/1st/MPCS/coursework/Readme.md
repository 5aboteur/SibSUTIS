# crc32changer

### --- Descr --------------------------

A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is an error-detecting code commonly used in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data. There are different instances of the CRC which mainly differ in the polynomial on which they are based on, resulting in different sizes of the computed value. The most popular one is the CRC-32, which computes a 32-bit value. This program allows you to get the current CRC value of the file and change it to another one.

This program requires `GTK+` library. Make sure that you already have it or just install the necessary package.
