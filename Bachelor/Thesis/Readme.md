### --- Descr --------------------------

Path tracing is the computer algorithm that allows us to get the physically based rendered image. It is embarrassingly parallel algorithm, so it is advisible to perform all calculations on a GPU device. To achieve this in the project I used OpenCL technology. I chose it because of its cross-platform entity.
